## Run server locally

A Flask server can be run locally in a Python virtual environment for development purposes. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the root directory.
2. Create a Python virtual environment by running `python -m venv venv`.
3. Activate the virtual environment by running `source venv/bin/activate` on Unix or `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows.
4. Install the required packages by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
5. Set the `FLASK_APP` environment variable by running `export FLASK_APP=cl34ry` on Unix or `set FLASK_APP=cl34ry` on Windows.
