<h1>Hello</h1>
<p>My name's Paul. I'm a Sr. Ecosystem Architect at Venafi, based in the Pacific Northwest.</p>
<p>I have years of experience building relationships with technology partners and supporting integration development. I bring a diverse range of interests and talents. I'm a self-starter with a passion for learning and a desire to help others. I draw inspiration for photography and design from the natural surroundings of the Pacific Northwest. In my free time, I enjoy disc golf and spending time with my family.</p>
